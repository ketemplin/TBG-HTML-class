<!-- how to test your JS to make sure it's working -->
	<p>console.log('hellow'); can be used to test whether the js is working, and try to figure out where it's failing.  It will print the word in the console when that specific action or piece of code is hit.</p>
	<p>if you're trying to figure out if an "on click" funciton is working, then could use 'click' to better track what's happening.  The '' means that it's a string (text). Without the '', it executes the function rather than printing out a word.</p>
